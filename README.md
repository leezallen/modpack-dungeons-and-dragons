## Dungeons and Dragons Modpack
Well, you know me... I have always liked creating hard modpacks. This pack is obviously inspired by RLCRAFT (in fact you could think of it as a fork if that helps). It is designed to be difficult, with lots to explore but nothing that will make the player too powerful... You will always have something to worry about!

### Getting Started
No more punching down trees! Go find some gravel, get some flint and break it down to make the initial tooks. I do aim to make a little getting started video at some point which I will put here but for now I want to concentrate on getting on with getting the pack finished!

### Changelog
See changelog.txt for details on the differences between different versions.
